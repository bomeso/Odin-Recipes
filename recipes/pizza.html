        <h3>Steps for the So-So Pizza</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F,  Lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
            <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar.

            <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. 
                <br>
                You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.

                Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle. 
                   <br> 
                Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
                <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
